# MyLifeNotes

This is a weekend project so far. The idea is to create a notes application that can share content between computers. There are a few nice notes applications out there, but none have all the features that we wanted. This is an attempt to create something that is close to our needs. 

This project uses Angular, FlexBox, Quill (ngx-quill), Electron, Electon-forge, etc, etc. This is to say that it is more of a compilation of technologies rather than building from scratch. To see all the technologies used look at the package.json file.

## Development 

When working only on the UI side you can use `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

When working on the backend and front-end use `npm run electron`. The app will automatically start in developer mode.

Another possibility is `npm start` but you need to build first.
